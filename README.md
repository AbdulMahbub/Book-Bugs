# Book-Bugs

This is an Android application I created using Android Studio. It contains a 2 column layout with a dialog box users can select in order to choose a book. The price and book name are extracted from the menu depending on what the user selects. After entering all their information, user can choose to submit their info, or reset all the options they have chosen.
